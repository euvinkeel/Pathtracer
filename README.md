# Pathtracer
A C++ pathtracer project for a computer graphics course (without source code.) If you're interested in the source code, [contact me.](mailto:euvinmkeel@gmail.com)

# README
Here's some renders this project can do:

Originally, this repo started out as a skeleton raytracer for the UCSD course CSE 168 Computer Graphics II: Rendering. Most features (depth of field, reflection, multiple-importance-sampling, embree) were added by me. The inclusion of Embree was encouraged but optional, and I opted to implement it.

The original README is included as OldREADME.md, which had the original installation instructions.

This project was meant to be run via Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022. When given a scene file (a specific format defining vertices, faces, camera data, and lights), a cmd prompt pops up to indicate render progress:
